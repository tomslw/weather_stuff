<h1> Main internship project </h1>
<p> So basically, because i couldn't actually help (because there wasn't enough time to teach me how to)
i was tasked with coming up with a project to do while in the internship and making it.<br></p>
<p><strong>This is that project</strong><br></p>
<h2>The concept</h2>
<p>Have an Arduino record the temperature and humidity, send that information to my computer
and put it all in a database. Have an simple web server running that displays the information.
I originally wanted a nice interface with a graph and everything, but i lost motivation while
looking into how i could actually do that and the the fact that all the http libraries that i found make
it a little more time consuming to display an actual html page didn't help. I am lazy i guess
and don't care that much about that right now. So a simple list of thing will do. Don't judge me.<br></p>
<h2> My goals </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Record weather data </li>
  <li> Have it stored in a database </li>
  <li> Have the info be accessible from anywhere </li>
  <li><strike>Have it look nice</strike></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Libraries/software that i used </strong></p>
